Using an ARCH model it is found that the evidence of volatility spillovers between these markets is minimal and have a duration which lasts only an hour or so. The most significant effects surround the movement of share prices around the New York opening, but these results are not strong. Several new ARCH models are estimated including an asymmetric or ‘leverage’ model and a non-linear model which allows big shocks to have a different impact from small shocks.},

	abstract = {Using Gretl, I apply ARMA, Vector ARMA, VAR, state-space model with a Kalman filter, transfer-function and intervention models, unit root tests, cointegration test, volatility models (ARCH, GARCH, ARCH-M, GARCH-M, Taylor-Schwert GARCH, GJR, TARCH, NARCH, APARCH, EGARCH) to analyze quarterly time series of GDP and Government Consumption Expenditures \& Gross Investment (GCEGI) from 1980 to 2013. The article is organized in three sections: (I) Definition; (II) Regression Models; (III) Discussion [Summary of Major Findings and Their Managerial Implications, Comparison of Empirical Results, Contributions to Literature, Limitations and Future Research, Gretl Scripts]. Additionally, I discovered a unique interaction between GDP and GCEGI in both the short-run and the long-run and provided policy makers with some suggestions. For example in the short run, GDP responded positively and very significantly (0.00248) to GCEGI, while GCEGI reacted positively but not too significantly (0.08051) to GDP. In the long run, current GDP responded negatively and permanently (0.09229) to a shock in past GCEGI, while current GCEGI reacted negatively yet temporarily (0.29821) to a shock in past GDP. Therefore, policy makers should not adjust current GCEGI based merely on the condition of current and past GDP. Although increasing GCEGI does help GDP in the short-term, significantly abrupt increase in GCEGI might not be good to the long-term health of GDP. Instead, a balanced, sustainable, and economically viable solution is recommended, so that the short-term benefits to the current economy from increasing GCEGI often largely secured by the long-term loan outweigh or at least equal to the negative effect to the future economy from the long-term debt incurred by the loan. Finally, I found that non-normally distributed volatility models generally perform better than normally distributed ones. More specifically, TARCH-GED performs the best in the group of non-normally distributed, while GARCH-M does the best in the group of normally distributed.},

Combination momentum-contrarian strategies, used to select from among 18 developed equity markets at a monthly frequency, outperform both pure momentum and pure contrarian strategies. The results continue to hold after corrections for factor sensitivities and transaction costs. They reveal the importance of controlling for mean reversion in exploiting momentum and vice versa.},

The strategy was originally designed for equity markets, but it also generates abnormal returns when applied to uncovered interest parity deviations for five countries. I find that the pattern for the positions thus created in the foreign exchange markets is qualitatively similar to that found in the equity markets. Quantitatively, this strategy performs better in foreign exchange markets than in equity markets. Also, it outperforms traditional foreign exchange trading strategies, such as carry trades and moving average rules.},

For purposes of quasi maximum likelihood estimation, innovations to GARCH processes are typically assumed to be identically and independently distributed with mean zero and unit variance (strong GARCH). Under less restrictive assumptions (absence of unconditional correlation, weak GARCH), higher order dependence patterns might be exploited for ex-ante forecasting of GARCH innovations and, hence, stock returns. In this paper, rolling windows of empirical stock returns are subjected to testing independence of consecutive GARCH innovations. Rolling p-values from independence testing reﬂect time variation of serial dependence, and entail useful information to signal one step ahead directions of stock price changes. Ex-ante forecasting gains are documented for non-parametric innovation predictions, in particular, if the sign of innovation predictors is combined with independence diagnostics (p-values) and/or the sign of linear return forecasts.},

We find no evidence that a GARCH(1,1) is outperformed by more sophisticated models in our analysis of exchange rates, whereas the GARCH(1,1) is clearly inferior to models that can accommodate a leverage effect in our analysis of IBM returns. The models are compared with the test for superior predictive ability (SPA) and the reality check for data snooping (RC).

Stock returns have shared variation due to the stock-market factors, and they are linked to bond returns through shared variation in the bond-market factors. Except for low-grade corporates, the bond-market factors capture the common variation in bond returns. Most important, the five factors seem to explain average returns on stocks and bonds.},

The proﬁt of a simpliﬁed pairs trading strategy is modeled by using a mean-reverting process of the futures price spread. According to the comparative statics of the model, the strong mean-reversion and high volatility of the spread give rise to the high expected return from trading. Analyzing energy futures (more speciﬁcally, WTI crude oil, heating oil, and natural gas futures) traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, we present empirical evidence that pairs trading can produce a relatively stable proﬁt. We also identify the sources of the proﬁt from a pair trading strategy, focusing on the characteristics of energy. The results suggest that natural gas futures trading may be more proﬁtable than WTI crude oil and heating oil due to its strong mean-reversion and high volatility, while seasonality may also be relevant to the strategy’s proﬁtability. Moreover, natural gas futures trading may be more vulnerable to event risk (as measured by price spikes) than the others. Finally, we investigate the proﬁtability of cross commodities pairs trading.},

	abstract = {The relationship between co-integration and error correction models, first suggested in Granger (1981), is here extended and used to develop estimation procedures, tests, and empirical examples. If each element of a vector of time series x$_{\textrm{t}}$ first achieves stationarity after differencing, but a linear combination {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\${\textbackslash}alpha {\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime \}x\_\{t\}\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater} is already stationary, the time series x$_{\textrm{t}}$ are said to be co-integrated with co-integrating vector α. There may be several such co-integrating vectors so that α becomes a matrix. Interpreting {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\${\textbackslash}alpha {\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime \}x\_\{t\}=0\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater} as a long run equilibrium, co-integration implies that deviations from equilibrium are stationary, with finite variance, even though the series themselves are nonstationary and have infinite variance. The paper presents a representation theorem based on Granger (1983), which connects the moving average, autoregressive, and error correction representations for co-integrated systems. A vector autoregression in differenced variables is incompatible with these representations. Estimation of these models is discussed and a simple but asymptotically efficient two-step estimator is proposed. Testing for co-integration combines the problems of unit root tests and tests with parameters unidentified under the null. Seven statistics are formulated and analyzed. The critical values of these statistics are calculated based on a Monte Carlo simulation. Using these critical values, the power properties of the tests are examined and one test procedure is recommended for application. In a series of examples it is found that consumption and income are co-integrated, wages and prices are not, short and long interest rates are, and nominal GNP is co-integrated with M2, but not M1, M3, or aggregate liquid assets.},

Essentially, the strategy involves choosing a pair of stocks that historically move together. By taking a long-short position on this pair when they diverge, a proﬁt will be made when they next converge to the mean by unwinding the position. Literature on this topic is rare due to its proprietary nature. Where it does exist, the strategies are either adhoc or applicable to special cases only, with little theoretical veriﬁcation. This paper analyzes these existing methods in detail and proposes a general approach to modeling relative mispricing for pairs trading purposes, with reference to the mainstream asset pricing theory. Several estimation techniques are discussed and tested for state space formulation, with Expectation Maximization producing stable results. Initial empirical evidence shows clear mean reversion behavior in selected pairs’ relative pricing.},

For the cointegration and copula methods, we design a computationally efficient two-step pairs trading strategy. In terms of economic outcomes, the distance, cointegration and copula methods show a mean monthly excess return of 91, 85 and 43 bps (38, 33 and 5 bps) before transaction costs (after transaction costs), respectively. In terms of continued profitability, from 2009, the frequency of trading opportunities via the distance and cointegration methods is reduced considerably, whereas this frequency remains stable for the copula method. Further, the copula method shows better performance for its unconverged trades compared to those of the other methods. While the liquidity factor is negatively correlated to all strategies’ returns, we find no evidence of their correlation to market excess returns. All strategies show positive and significant alphas after accounting for various risk-factors. We also find that in addition to all strategies performing better during periods of significant volatility, the cointegration method is the superior strategy during turbulent market conditions.},

	abstract = {This paper develops an asymptotic theory for residual based tests for cointegration. These tests involve procedures that are designed to detect the presence of a unit root in the residuals of (cointegrating) regressions among the levels of economic time series. Attention is given to the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test that is recommended by Engle-Granger (1987) and the Z$_{\textrm{α}}$ and Z$_{\textrm{t}}$ unit root tests recently proposed by Phillips (1987). Two new tests are also introduced, one of which is invariant to the normalization of the cointegrating regression. All of these tests are shown to be asymptotically similar and simple representations of their limiting distributions are given in terms of standard Brownian motion. The ADF and Z$_{\textrm{t}}$ tests are asymptotically equivalent. Power properties of the tests are also studied. The analysis shows that all the tests are consistent if suitably constructed but that the ADF and Z$_{\textrm{t}}$ tests have slower rates of divergence under cointegration than the other tests. This indicates that, at least in large samples, the Z$_{\textrm{α}}$ test should have superior power properties. The paper concludes by addressing the larger issue of test formulation. Some major pitfalls are discovered in procedures that are designed to test a null of cointegration (rather than no cointegration). These defects provide strong arguments against the indiscriminate use of such test formulations and support the continuing use of residual based unit root tests. A full set of critical values for residual based tests is included. These allow for demeaned and detrended data and cointegrating regressions with up to five variables.},
